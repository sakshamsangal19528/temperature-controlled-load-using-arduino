<h2><i>This repository contains the source code for the project "Temp controlled load using arduino". </i></h2>

<h3><i>For this to work you have to 1st download arduino IDE then  
  <br>
  you also have to download 3 libraries which are-</i></h3>
<p>

1.) one wire library // https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/onewire/
  <br>
2.) dallas temperature library// https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/dallastemperature/
  <br>
3.) liquid crystal library // https://github.com/junwha0511/LiquidCrystal_I2C_Hangul
</p>
you can either download them directly inside the arduino IDE by following these steps
<br>
go to->  [ sketch>include library>manage libraries>"search these 3 libraries and add them" ]. 
<br>
You can also download them from any browser (download links are given above) and then transfer them to this destination- 
<br>
[ "C:\Users\ "your current user" \Documents\Arduino\libraries" ]  in your computer.
<br>
<br>
After completing this you can download the "temp. controlled load using arduino.ino" file from the repository and open it inside your arduino IDE for any modifications.
